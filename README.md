Challenge 20-Supervised Machine Learning

# Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Software/Libraries/Tools
Jupyter Notebook, train_test_split, 

# Concepts Covered
logistic regression model, predictive modeling, credit risk analysis report, confusion matrix, classification report, training & testing sets

# Credit Risk folder
credit_risk_starter, credit_risk_final, lending_data.csv

# Credit Risk Analysis Report
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. By identifying high-risk loans, the model aims to assist the company in mitigating potential losses and making informed lending decisions.

## Results
Accuracy Score: 0.99
Precision Score (Label 0 - Healthy Loans): 1.00
Recall Score (Label 0 - Healthy Loans): 1.00
Precision Score (Label 1 - High-Risk Loans): 0.87
Recall Score (Label 1 - High-Risk Loans): 0.89
F1-Score (Label 0 - Healthy Loans): 1.00
F1-Score (Label 1 - High-Risk Loans): 0.88
Macro Average Precision Score: 0.94
Macro Average Recall Score: 0.94
Macro Average F1-Score: 0.94
Weighted Average Precision Score: 0.99
Weighted Average Recall Score: 0.99
Weighted Average F1-Score: 0.99

## Recommendation
I recommend the adoption of this logistic regression model for use by the company. Its robust performance, particularly in accurately identifying healthy loans and effectively flagging high-risk loans, provides a strong foundation for improving the company’s lending decisions and minimizing financial risk. Continued monitoring and periodic retraining with updated data are advised to maintain and potentially enhance the model's performance over time.
